# problem
* given an integer array `nums`, `K` and `L` , check if there are two numbers inside [i-K, i + K] window for i in range of size of nums that difference is smaller than L.
* ex:
    ```
    [1,2,1,3,4]
    K = 1
    L = 1
    nums[2] - nums[0] = 0 which is smaller than 1 , return true
    ```

# explanation
```
we want to check for every in [i-k, i+k] window for every i, any two numbers difference smaller than L
  i-k  i+k
   v i v
   | | |
   | | |
   v v v
[1,2,1,3,4]

It is very simialr to two sum problem, where while we are visiting nums[i], we want to know
what number we have in the past, though in this problem, it has restriction that number need to be
within a window and the past number we are looking for is under a range

first, come up with criteria, it is :
abs(curr - prev) < L
=> -L < curr-prev < L
=> -L - curr < -prev < L - curr
=> curr - L < prev < curr + L

since when we are visiting nums[i], we want to find any value with in certain range in the window,
we need to use a sorted structure to hold the value in windows, here we choose treeMap.
( the reason using treeMap instead of treeSet is to handle case where we have duplicated numbers)

# code
```cpp
bool diffSmaller(vector<int> &nums, int k, int L) {
    map<int, int> treeMap;
    int maxWinSize = 2*k+1;
    int currSize = 0;
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // looking for any previous value under range of val + L > prev > val -L
        int lower = nums[i] - L;
        int upper = nums[i] + L;
        auto it = treeMap.upper_bound(lower); // looking for first item bigger than lower
        if (it != treeMap.end() && it->first < upper) {
            // and if the val is also smaller than upper bound , exist
            return true;
        }
        treeMap[nums[i]]++;
        currSize++;
        if (currSize >= maxWinSize) {
            int valToRm = nums[i- currSize + 1];
            // if after removing the size is 0, remove the key
            if (treeMap[valToRm]-- == 1) {
                treeMap.erase(valToRm);
            }
            currSize--;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

# example walk through
```
K = 1
L = 1
[1,2,1,3,4]
 0 1 2 3 4

lower = curr - L
upper = curr + L

i     lower    upper    treeMap       currSize
0       0        2        {1:1}         1
1       1        3        {1:1, 2:1}    2
2       0        2       ( here see 1 exist in treeMap return true)
```

# complexity
* time complexity : O(nlogk), since visiting each item and for each item do search/insert in treemap take log(k) as k is treeMap size.
* space complexity: O(n), since treeMap to hold the numbers within window
